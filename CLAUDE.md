# Flows Overview

Flows is a workflow automation tool targeted at DevOps engineers. You have blocks on a canvas connected by lines. Those blocks may have multiple inputs and outputs on which they send and receive events. We call these blocks "entities" as they can be very powerful. New entities can be implemented by means of apps which are implemented in JavaScript. Those entities can have http endpoints, manage infrastructure resources, have a lifecycle, and more. Entities live in flows.

All configuration expressions and the code of apps are executed on agents, which are connected to the gateway via websockets. Those agents are responsible for managing Node.js runtimes for apps and for flows.

This repository is an app repo based on our Flows App Template. It can be used as a starting point for building new Flows apps.

When working on the app, **always** make sure to read the appRuntime.ts from https://docs.useflows.com/appRuntime.ts . This is later injected by the Flows runtime, you should never include it yourself. It's presented there as a reference.

If necessary, you may also consider reading the documentation about building Flows apps at https://docs.useflows.com/developers/building-apps/ , specifically:

## Overview

This app demonstrates the standard patterns for Flows apps:

- Clean configuration schema with secrets support
- Simple block structure with proper error handling
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline

## Architecture

### App Structure

```text
{{app_name}}/
├── blocks/                   # Block implementations
│   ├── index.ts              # Block registry and exports
│   └── exampleBlock.ts       # Example block implementation
├── .github/workflows/ci.yml  # CI/CD pipeline
├── main.ts                   # App definition
├── package.json              # Dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md                 # Documentation and setup guide
```

### Key Components

#### Configuration (`main.ts`)

The app requires two configuration values:

- `apiKey` (secret) - API authentication key
- `baseUrl` (text) - API endpoint URL with default value

#### Block Organization (`blocks/`)

The template uses a clean block organization pattern:

- **`blocks/index.ts`** - Central registry that exports all blocks as a dictionary
- **`blocks/exampleBlock.ts`** - Example block implementation
- **`main.ts`** - Imports blocks via `Object.values(blocks)` for clean registration

**Example Block Features:**

- Accepts a text message as input
- Uses the configured API key and base URL
- Returns a processed result or throws errors
- Follows standard error handling patterns

## Implementation Patterns

### Block Structure

```typescript
const exampleBlock: AppBlock = {
  name: "Block Name",
  description: "What this block does",
  category: "Category",

  inputs: {
    default: {
      name: "Input Name",
      description: "Input description",
      config: {
        /* JSON Schema */
      },
      onEvent: async (input, { events }) => {
        // Block logic with error handling
      },
    },
  },

  outputs: {
    default: {
      name: "Output Name",
      description: "Output description",
      type: {
        /* JSON Schema */
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
// Block logic - just throw errors, don't wrap in success/failure objects
const result = await someOperation();
await events.emit(result);
```

### Configuration Access

```typescript
const apiKey = input.app.config.apiKey as string;
const baseUrl = input.app.config.baseUrl as string;
```

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

1. **Setup**: `npm install`
2. **Type Check**: `npm run typecheck`
3. **Format**: `npm run format`
4. **Bundle**: `npm run bundle`

### Release Process

1. **Develop**: Make changes and test locally
2. **Commit**: Push to feature branch
3. **Review**: Create PR, wait for CI validation
4. **Release**: Tag with `v1.0.0` format
5. **Deploy**: CI automatically creates release and updates registry

### CI/CD Pipeline

The template includes a complete CI/CD system:

- **Quality Gates**: Type checking, formatting validation
- **Automated Releases**: Tag-triggered GitHub releases
- **Version Registry**: Self-maintaining `versions.json`
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch protected, requires CI

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

- Modular block structure in `blocks/` directory
- Central block registry for easy management
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive type definitions

### Error Handling

- Let errors bubble up naturally - don't catch and wrap them
- Use descriptive error messages
- The framework will handle error catching and reporting

### Security

- Use `sensitive: true` for sensitive configuration
- Never log sensitive data
- Validate all inputs

### Documentation

- Clear block names and descriptions
- Comprehensive README
- Type annotations for all interfaces

## Extension Guidelines

### Adding New Blocks

1. Create block file in `blocks/` directory (e.g., `blocks/myBlock.ts`)
2. Import and add to `blocks` dictionary in `blocks/index.ts`
3. Export from `blocks/index.ts` for external use
4. Test with `npm run typecheck`

**Example:**

```typescript
// blocks/myBlock.ts
export const myBlock: AppBlock = {
  /* block definition */
};

// blocks/index.ts
import { myBlock } from "./myBlock.ts";
export const blocks = {
  example: exampleBlock,
  my: myBlock, // Add here
} as const;
```

### Adding Configuration

1. Update config schema in `main.ts`
2. Access via `input.app.config.fieldName`

### Adding Dependencies

1. Add to package.json dependencies
2. Import in relevant files
3. Ensure TypeScript types are available

This template provides a solid foundation for building production-ready Flows apps with modern development practices and automated deployment.

## Testing the App

The app can be submitted to Flows as a custom app, or added to a registry.

The user can use [flowctl](https://github.com/spacelift-io/flowctl) to create a custom app in their Flows organization, and then a version of the app inside of that. They will more or less have to run:
```
flowctl auth login # Follow the prompts to authenticate
flowctl app create # Follow the prompts to create the app
flowctl version update --entrypoint main.ts --watch # Follow the prompts to create a version in watch mode - this will update the app live as you make changes. Can skip --watch to just do a one-time upload.
```
